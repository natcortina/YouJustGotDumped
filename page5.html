<h1>   <div class="colorname"> <h1 id="text"> <span id="name"> </span> , </h1> </div>   MINDFULNESS IS WHAT YOU NEED ! great progress you have here. </h1>


<div class="hello">  Mindfulness means that you maintain a self awareness in the present moment, without judgement. </div>


<div class = "hello"> It means taking care of yourself, for yourself. </div> 

<div class = "hello"> The basic things you can incorporate to your day can be:  </div> 

<ul>

	 <li class="list"> <span class="highlight">Wake up and scream</span> into your pillow for 5 minutes straight. Yeah, it's gonna sound crazy to your roommates, but it'll feel damn good to let out all that pent-up anger and frustration.</li>


		<li class="list">Take a <span class="highlight"> cold shower </span> to shock your system awake and get your blood pumping. Cry as much as you want, nobody can see your tears when there's water falling down your face.</li>

		<li class="list" >  <span class="highlight"> Write in a journal </span> for 10 minutes every morning. Write down all the crappy feelings you're experiencing and then <span class="highlight"> crumple up the page </span> and throw it away. Symbolic, right?</li>

		<li class="list">Do some  <span class="highlight"> yoga or stretching  </span> to release all that tension you've been holding in your body. Maybe try some hip openers to release any blocked emotions. Plus, it's a good excuse to wear those <span class="highlight"> cute workout fit  </span> you've been eyeing.</li>

		<li class="list"> <span class="highlight"> Meditate  </span> for at least 15 minutes a day. Visualize yourself moving on and being happy without your ex. Don't worry if you get distracted, just bring your attention back to your breath and the image of you thriving without them.</li>

	</ul>


	<p>Remember, getting over a break up is hard, but you're a badass who can handle anything. Just take it one day at a time, and don't forget to love yourself along the way.</p>
